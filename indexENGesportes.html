        <h1 class="tamanhoItem">SPORTS</h1>
        <h2 class="tamanhoItem">HAIKYUU, SUPER ONZE, BLUE LOCK</h2>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Even within the anime universe, Brazil often appears prominently when the topic is sports. This is not surprising: Brazil was once a global reference in football and, in recent decades, has become a growing powerhouse in volleyball.</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">This sporting strength inspires many Japanese authors, who frequently include Brazilian athletes or references to Brazil’s playing style, especially in football and volleyball anime such as Inazuma Eleven, Blue Lock, and Haikyuu.</p>

        <h2 class="tamanhoItem">HAIKYUU (Sports, Shounen, Slice of Life)</h2>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Author: Haruichi Furudate;</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Manga release: February 2012;</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Anime release: April 2014;</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Description: Haikyuu tells the story of teenagers passionate about volleyball. The protagonist must join forces with his rival in order to reach the top. The anime balances comedy that lightens the mood with tense and emotional moments that bring the audience closer to the characters.
        </p>

        <h3 class="tamanhoItem">Season 1, Episode 4</h3>
        <p class="tamanhoItem">At the beginning of episode 4, we encounter a quote by Bernardinho (former coach of the Brazilian national volleyball team). According to him, dedication, perseverance, determination, and a dose of talent are essential. One must be passionate about what they do and know how to work as a team.
</p>
        <p  class="tamanhoItem bold">“Players are not soloists; they are members of an orchestra. When a player believes they are special, that is their end.” — Bernardinho</p>

        <h3 class="tamanhoItem">Volumes 42 and 43 (manga)</h3>
        <p class="tamanhoItem">Among the many representations in volumes 42 and 43 of the manga, the first reference appears when Hinata is learning about beach volleyball and watches a match between Brazil and Poland.</p>
        <img src="img/haikyu42b.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="In the image, Hinata is watching a beach volleyball match on 'New Tube', an alternative YouTube channel in the anime.">
        <figcaption class="tamanhoItem">Hinata watching a beach volleyball match between Brazil and Poland.</figcaption>

        <p class="tamanhoItem">Another reference is accompanied by a very common stereotype in both foreign and Brazilian perspectives. In one panel, we see Hinata shortly after arriving in Brazil, taking the classic tourist photo with Christ the Redeemer, one of Rio de Janeiro’s most famous landmarks.</p>
        <p class="tamanhoItem">In the following panel, Yachi, a former high school classmate, worries about Hinata and hopes he will not die. This stereotype is presented humorously, reflecting the way Brazil—and especially Rio de Janeiro—is often imagined as a dangerous place.</p>
        <figure> 
        <img  class="tamanhoItem" src="img/haikyu41a.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="In the right-hand image, we find a photo of Hinata posing with Christ the Redeemer. In the middle right-hand image, we see Yachi worried about her friend, since he is in Brazil."> 
        <figcaption  class="tamanhoItem">Hinata posing with Christ the Redeemer, and we have a worried Yachi.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="tamanhoItem">An interesting curiosity about Haikyuu is that in 2019, Haruichi Furudate traveled to Rio de Janeiro to gather material for Hinata’s time-skip arc in Brazil. As a result, the manga presents a rich level of regional detail, with Hinata’s new routine shown through detailed backgrounds, street signs, busy roads, and everyday life.</p>
        <p class="tamanhoItem">In one scene, we are introduced to Hinata’s new daily routine. He gets a part-time job, but due to his lack of knowledge of Portuguese, he gets lost, delivers orders late, and is unable to explain the reason for the delay.</p>
        <img src="img/haikyu42d.jpg" width="560" height="700" alt="The image shows various elements that depict the daily life of a Brazilian: a market, road signs, and streets full of people.">
        <figcaption  class="tamanhoItem">Busy streets filled with symbols.</figcaption>
        
        <p class="tamanhoItem">Later, without realizing it, Hinata is robbed. </p>
        <img src="img/haikyu42e.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Hinata looked at his backpack, realizing it had been stolen.">
        <figcaption class="tamanhoItem">Hinata realizing he lost his wallet...</figcaption>

        <p class="tamanhoItem">Brazilian cuisine is also highlighted as one of the country’s best qualities. Brazilian food stands out even abroad for its abundance and variety. In one panel, Brazilian food is described as good, healthy, and cheap (even though Hinata’s reason for saying this is somewhat different ><). </p>
        <img src="img/haikyu42g.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="In the image, Hinata and Oikawa decide to go out to eat, and Hinata recommends a place where the food is good, healthy, and cheap. Next, there is an image of three plates full of food.">
        <figcaption class="tamanhoItem">Lunch!</figcaption>
        
        <p class="tamanhoItem">Finally, at the end of Hinata’s journey in Brazil, souvenirs could not be forgotten. He chooses a miniature of Christ the Redeemer.</p>
        <img src="img/haikyu43.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="The image shows the souvenirs Hinata is taking home to her friends in Japan, a miniature of Christ the Redeemer.">

        <h2 class="tamanhoItem">SUPER ONZE Orion no Kokuin (Action, Sports, Fantasy and Shounen)</h2>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Author: Akihiro Hino;</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Manga release: No manga adaptation;</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Anime release: Outober 2018</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Description: Inazuma Eleven: Orion no Kokuin follows the new Japanese national team, Inazuma Japan, during the Football Frontier International (FFI), where they face teams from around the world. The story involves themes of overcoming challenges and mysteries surrounding a secret organization behind the tournament, expanding the Inazuma Eleven universe.</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Reference(s): Extroverted and charismatic characters, samba, and Carnival.</p>

        <h3 class="tamanhoItem">Episodes 41 and 42</h3>
        <p class="tamanhoItem">During episodes 41 and 42, the match between Japan and Brazil takes place in the Football Frontier International. From the beginning, the Brazilian team is introduced as energetic and charismatic, entering the field playing drums and dancing samba—a striking entrance filled with cultural references.</p>
        <p class="tamanhoItem">Throughout the match, this identity is reinforced through special techniques such as Death Samba and Carnival Shake, both inspired by Brazilian music and festivities.</p>

        <h2 class="tamanhoItem">BLUE LOCK (Action, Sports, Shounen, Psicological)</h2>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Author: Maneyuki Kaneshiro;</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Manga release: 2018;</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Anime release: Outober 2022;</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Description: Another football anime, but one that stands out for having “egoism” as one of its central themes. The story follows the creation of the Blue Lock project, designed to produce the world’s best striker after Japan’s humiliating defeat in the World Cup. It is a high-adrenaline series filled with intense competitions and characters determined to surpass their limits.</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Reference (s): Homages to Dada, Zico and Pelé.</p>
        
        <h3 class="tamanhoItem">Throughout the anime</h3>
        <p class="tamanhoItem">Throughout Blue Lock, characters frequently reference famous football players who inspire them to chase their dreams and become the best. These players come from various nationalities, but Brazilian players receive particular emphasis.</p>

        <img class="tamanhoItem" src="img/PSX_20251212_232245.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="In the image, we have Dada Maravilha being honored.">

        <figcaption class="tamanhoItem">Homage to Zico</figcaption>
        
        <p class="tamanhoItem">In one of the early episodes of Blue Lock, it shows why Pelé was "Number 1." - Pelé, the greatest player in history… and three-time World Cup champion, said… “the best striker in the world, the best midfielder in the world, the best defender in the world, the best goalkeeper in the world…” “…no matter the question, I will always answer that it is me.”</p>
