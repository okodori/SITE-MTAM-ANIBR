        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Even in slice-of-life anime, which depict everyday and seemingly simple situations, we can find interesting cultural representations. The focus of this type of work is not on major conflicts, but rather on the small details of our ordinary daily lives.</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Brazil ends up being represented in a more stereotypical way, with more charismatic characters associated with extroversion.</p>

        <h2 class="tamanhoItem">SKULL-FACE BOOKSELLER HONDA-SAN (Comedy, Shoujo, Slice of life)</h2>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Author: Honda;</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Anime release: August 2015;</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Anime release: 2018;</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Description: Have you ever wondered what it is like to sell manga in a Japanese bookstore? Based on the author’s real-life experiences, Skull-face Bookseller Honda-san presents humorous first-hand accounts of working in a bookstore, dealing with out-of-print books, enthusiastic manga fans, and everyday challenges.</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Reference (s): The extroverted Brazilian tourist.</p>

        <h3 class="cont tamanhoItem">Episode 5</h3>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">On a typical day at the bookstore, Honda-san is faced with an unexpected task: answering a Brazilian tourist's questions. The tourist, seemingly lost but quite enthusiastic, was curious about the difference between Japanese manga and European comics. The Brazilian tourist is shown hugging Honda-san in gratitude and taking a picture with him. I believe this scene says a lot about the kind of people we are and how we are perceived in the world.</p>

        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Manga release: No manga adaptation;</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Anime release: July 2024;</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">DDescription: Nare Nare Cheer for You is an original anime about high school girls who form a cheerleading group called “PoMPoMs,” focusing on overcoming trauma, friendship, and the power of inspiring others. </p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Reference (s): An energetic character, the Brazilian flag, and Brazilian ancestry.</p>

        <h3 class="cont tamanhoItem">Throughout the anime</h3>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">As mentioned in the anime Skull-face bookseller Honsa-san, in Slice of Life anime, Brazilian characters are represented in an animated way, hugging people and talking without shame. This also applies to the character Anna. A Brazilian woman, whose appearance, in addition to her personality, also draws a lot of attention from viewers. Yes, we are talking about her colors, which are reminiscent of the Brazilian flag: blue, yellow, and green.</p>
        <img src="img/2f508d2ad2345b42210049192cbab7da (1).jpg" width="560" height="415" alt="The image shows a smiling female character. What stands out about her appearance are her blue eyes, her hair, and her yellow and green blouse, colors that represent the Brazilian flag.">
        <figcaption class="cont tamanhoItem">Anna Aveiro Nakamura dos Santos Moreira Cuccittini.</figcaption>
        
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">One interesting fact about Anna is that her long last name is a tribute to several football players, such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, and Ronaldinho.</p>
        <p class="cont tamanhoItem">Besides its distinctive name, Anna Aveiro Nakamura dos Santos Moreira Cuccittini is the representation of a Brazilian person (in the eyes of a foreigner), being an extroverted person who enjoys physical contact such as greeting with hugs and kisses, even if she barely knows the person. </p>
